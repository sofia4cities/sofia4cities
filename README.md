Sofia4Cities 
============================

Sofia4Cities is an multi-purpose, enterprise and open-source platform for building complete end-to-end solutions, connected applications, and smart products. 
The platform provides an open toolkit for the IoT/Smart product development that reduces associated cost, risks, and time-to-market.


Sofia4Cities (powered by onesait Platform) is the Internet-of-Everything platform with which minsait has attended the Select4Cities contest.
Sofia4Cities is one of the 3 platforms that have reached the final stage: https://www.select4cities.eu/phase-3-winners

During phase 2 of the project, the platform code was hosted in the Github repository https://github.com/sofia4cities/ where its last stable branch is 5.2.0: https://github.com/sofia4cities/sofia4cities/ tree / 5.2.0

In phase 3 the platform has continued to evolve, and it has been decided to host the code in the Github repository of the parent platform onesait Platform in order to find
synergies between both communities and that the efforts of both projects come together.
