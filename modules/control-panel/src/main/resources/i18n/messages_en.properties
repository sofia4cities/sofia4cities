#Messages for the Tooltips
tooltip_ontologies=Ontologies are the data models within the platform. They are represented via a JSON-Schema (JSON for the instances) and transparently to the programmer can be stored in different types of storage.
tooltip_clients= Device represents each of the clients of the platform, typically they are devices sending information to the platform, but they can be devices subscribed to other information, mobile or web applications visualizing information stored on the platform or complete systems. A Device handles 1 or more ontologies.
tooltip_rules=A Rule represents the execution of a more or less complex logic, the Rules can be executed before the arrival of an Instance or with a temporal planning (CRON). The Rules can be of type IF-THEN (Script Rules) or of type CEP (temporary relationship between several instances). The Rules can be created in different languages (R, Python, Groovy) through the Console itself....
tooltip_visualization=The Visualization Tools allow me to exploit in a simple and graphic way the information stored in the Platform (Ontologies). I can create unit display elements (Gadgets), join them in a web page (Dashboard).
tooltip_tools=Support tools for development, operation, ...
tooltip_administration=Platform administration tools: user management, platform monitoring, operations management, security.
tooltip_apiManager=The API Manager allows you to publish APIS on all the information managed by the Platform, all in a visual way.

##wizard CREATE ontologia paso a paso

wizard_proyectos_on_paso_intro=A Sofia2 Ontology is created using a JSON schema. It defines the properties, datatypes and restrictions of the entities that the ThinKPs exchange with the Platform.<br>If you're not familiar with JSON schemas, you can use this wizard.

wizard_proyectos_on_paso_Dat=Data
wizard_proyectos_on_paso_datos=In order to create your ontology, we need the following data:<br> <br>Check <b>Active</b> to activate it and to make it accessible, and <b>Public</b> to allow public access to the ontology.<br> <br>You can also add <b>Meta-Inf</b> tags used at the Open Data portal searches.
wizard_proyectos_on_paso_bdtr1=Configure the time period in which the data will remain at the real-time database (RTDB) before being migrated to the Historic Database (HDB).
wizard_proyectos_on_paso_bdtr2=You can create a parent-child ontology hierarchy on a group of ontologies that share a common structure, defined in the parent ontology. You can choose between:<br> <br><b>Parent Ontologies.</b> They are abstract (non-instantiable) ontologies that serve as a "Template" to child ontologies. <b>Child ontologies.</b>They are ontologies that extend a parent ontology and have an schema of their own. They have specific configuration (security, historic database migration, etc). <b>General type ontologies.</b> The ontologies you already are familiar with.

wizard_proyectos_on_paso_bdtr3=The available datatypes to create properties from the Wizard are the ones from the JSON schema specification (string, number, integer, boolean, array), along with the timestamp and geometry types. The last two ones allow the Platform to fully exploit the capabilities of the real-time database. Once all the attributes have been defined, they will appear in the properties table. If you no longer need one of them, it can be deleted.<br> <br>After clicking <b>Generate Ontology</b>, you will see the result in the following step.
wizard_proyectos_on_paso_aniadir_prop=Add Properties
